1. Simple Linear Regression
   Single independent features corresponding to that single dependent features.

   Multiple Linear Regression
   Multiple independent features corresponding to that single dependant features.

2. In simple linear regression, when we plot the graph, it is a single line whereas in multiple linear regression,
    there is a 3-d plot, we have to visualize 3-d as there are so many x-axis(x1,x2,x3........xn)[Independent Variables].
    The graph comes in plane format in multiple linear regression.
