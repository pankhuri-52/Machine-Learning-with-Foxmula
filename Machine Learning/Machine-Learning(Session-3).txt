1. Simple Linear Regression
   Single independent features corresponding to that single dependent features.

   Multiple Linear Regression
   Multiple independent features corresponding to that single dependant features.

2. In simple linear regression, when we plot the graph, it is a single line whereas in multiple linear regression,
    there is a 3-d plot, we have to visualize 3-d as there are so many x-axis(x1,x2,x3........xn)[Independent Variables].
    The graph comes in plane format in multiple linear regression.

3. We have TV, Radio and Newspapers as independent features and corresponding to that we have to find out the sales
   which we get by advertising TV, Radio or Newspaper.

4. describe() method is used for finding statistical information about our dataset like mean, standard deviation, min, max etc.
